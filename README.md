## What is design patterns? 

They are some patterns defined to help us solve regular problems.

There are some different types of Design Patterns, being the most used and know the following: 

* Creational (creating objects)
* Structural (structural classes)
* Behavioral (calling methods)
* Other types

Why should I use a design pattern?
They are usually used to solve problems of complex structures. 

Problems?
"Limit innovation" when we are going to use a defined pattern, but most people do prefer to use these patterns.
"Languages should provide the solution" Why Java does not provide a Singleton for us?
